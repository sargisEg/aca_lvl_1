Create an ApiTestCallable Callable implementation that has the following parameters:

String testDescription;
String testName;

Implement the callable in a way that in 2 seconds it returns a test result (randomly either fail or pass, testName and testDescription);

Create 5000 ApiTestCallable objects and submit them to the cached thread pool executor. 
The testDescription should be "test description $number" (test description 1, test description 2, ....)
The testName should be "test$number" (test1, test2, ....)

Add the submitted future result in a shared map where the key is equal to testName and the value is the test result (test status, name, and description).

Print the map content.

Make sure that the map size is 5000. Write a unit test and assert the map size.
