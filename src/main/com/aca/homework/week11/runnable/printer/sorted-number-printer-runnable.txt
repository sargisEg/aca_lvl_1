Create a SortedNumberPrinterRunnable class that implements a java.lang.Runnable interface.

The run method should pause randommly from 10 to 200ms (the time should be determined in constructor) and print the provided single number.

Create a set of SortedNumberPrinterRunnable in createRunnables method to print numbers from 1 to 100.
Create a runAll method that takes a set of runnables and executes them.

Create a main method, invoke createRunnables and runAll methods in it. 

First the runnables that takes less time to be executed should run

There is no need to create unit tests.
