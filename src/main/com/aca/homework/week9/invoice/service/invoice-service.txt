Create a InvoiceReader class that has int Invoice[] read() method and read data from the invoice.txt file,
 each line converts to the Invoice class and returns an array of the Invoices.

The Invoice class has the following fields:
id
amount
type
code

Implement the toString method and write testToString unit test.

Create an InvoiceService class that has load() method which reads the data from invoice.txt file using the InvoiceReader class instance.
The InvoiceService class also has long totalAmountByType(InvoiceType type) that returns the sum of invoices' amount,
Invoice[] getByType(InvoiceType type) that returns an array of invoces that contains only the invoices of the provided type,
Invoice[] getByTypeAndCode(InvoiceType type, String code) that returns an array of invoces that contains only the invoices of the provided type and code.

Write the following tests:

testTotalAmountByTypeSAD() // load the data first using extended InvoiceReader clas, run the totalAmountByType(InvoiceType.SAD) and make the assertion
testGetBySADType() // load the data first using extended InvoiceReader class, run the getByType(InvoiceType.SAD) then make assertions
testGetByMANType() // load the data first using extended InvoiceReader class, run the getByType(InvoiceType.MAN) then make assertions
getBySADTypeAndCode() // load the data first using extended InvoiceReader class, run the getByTypeAndCode(InvoiceType.MAN, "MY-CODE") then make assertions
