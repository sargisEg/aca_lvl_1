There are printed motorcycle plate numbers. A user having a passport can easily take a plate number if it is free, also he/she can see all plate numbers that belong to him/her.

The number format is:

XX YYY

where XX can be any combination of A, B, and C letters, and YY can be any combination of 0 to 9 numbers.

an example of a plate number is: 'AC 748'

Create a NumberPlateService and using a create method in the Main class create numbers with all possible combinations. (use multithreading best practices to create numbers)

A user that has a passport id, first name, and second name can own 0 or more plate numbers.

Create User and UserPlateNumber entities, UserService and UserPlateNumberService services.

Create UserPlateNumberFacade that has the ability to take a plate number if it is free, able to see all numbers that the user has.

There is no need to create tests.
