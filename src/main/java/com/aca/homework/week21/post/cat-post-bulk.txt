Create a bulk post creation resource that allows users to create more than 1 cat post in one endpoint invocation.

the mapping should be:

POST /posts/bulk

Users should POST a DTO that contains createdBy and count fields only.

Use concurrency to increase bulk post creation performance.

The response DTO should contain a list of post DTOs.

When the post is created via bulk API, the post content should start with the "prefix" described in the application.properties.
