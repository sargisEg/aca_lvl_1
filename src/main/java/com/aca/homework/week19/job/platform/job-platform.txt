There is a platform that allows users to sign up and mark themself as open for job offers.
The HR user can invite a user to an interview in one of the registered companies.
If the user accepts that invitation he will receive an interview date and time.
HR can not send an invitation if the user is not open to job offers.
After an interview HR user can hire (also reject) that user to the company.

Create a UserFacade that has methods with names:

UserDetailsDto signUp(UserSignUpRequestDto dto)    
UserDetailsDto getUserDetails(Long userId)
UserDetailsDto openToWork(Long userId) // marks a user as open for job offers

OrganizationFacade

OrganizationDetailsDto register(OrganizationRegistrationRequestDto dto)
OrganizationDetailsDto getOrganizationDetails(Long organizationId)

The OrganizationDetailsDto should contain a list of employees (UserDetailsDto)

InvitationFacade

InvitationDetailsDto sendInvitation(InvitationRequestDto dto) // request should contain valid user id, organization id
InvitationDetailsDto accepctInvitation(InvitationAcceptDto dto) // request should contain valid user id, invitation id
InvitationDetailsDto rejectInvitation(InvitationRejectDto dto)

the InvitationDetailsDto should have contained invitation status, user details, organization information

JobFacade

JobHireResponseDto hire(JobHireRequestDto dto)
