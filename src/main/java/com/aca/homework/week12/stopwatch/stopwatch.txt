Create a StopWatch class that takes a DisplayType as an argument and has a start method.

There are 2 type of DisplayTypes: SECONDS_AND_MILLIS and SECONDS

When the SECONDS_AND_MILLIS format is chosen, the StopWatch should print the elapsed time in this format: XX.yyy, where XX is seconds and yyy is milliseconds.

The format in the case of SECONDS is: XX

For both SECONDS_AND_MILLIS and SECONDS update rate should be ~10ms


Unit tests should be written for some methods.
