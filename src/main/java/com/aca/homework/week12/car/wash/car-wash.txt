The Car Wash service named JILLY’S, has a promotion: every 5th wash is free.

Create a CarWash class that has a double wash(String plateNumber) method. The method returns a wash price.

Create a CarReporitory interface that has the following methods: 
void save(Object data)
Object load()

Create 2 CarRepository implementations. One saves a data object in a file using ObjectOutputStream, and the second for unit testing purposes.


Create a CarWashUnitTest class and write the following tests:

testWash1Time()
testWash5Times()
testWash6Times()
testWash10Times()
testGetName()

note: every time when a CarWash object is created,
      the data should be loaded for the .txt file for that specific car wash
      (JILLY’S data should be loaded from JILLY’S.txt file,
       SONAX data should be NextCarfrom NextCar.txt, and so on) and
       every time when a car been washed, the data should be saved in .txt file.
