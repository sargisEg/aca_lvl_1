Create a CommitAnalyzer class that has 

int count() method that returns the total commits count.

The CommitAnalyzer should take a file in the constructor. 
Implement the count method by using the JSON schema provided in the commits-data.txt.

Create CommitAnalyzerTest class and write testCount() for the provided commits-data.txt text file.


To parse the JSON the jackson-databind library should be used (objectMapper.readValue(***))
