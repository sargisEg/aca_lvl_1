Create a User class that is annotated with @Table(name = "USERS") annotation and has the following fields:

@Column(name = "username")
private String username;

@Column(name = "name")
private String name;

Create a UserRepository class that has a void save(User user) method.

The UserRepository takes a ConnectionFactory in the constructor.
The save method should get a DB connection from the connection factory, save the provided user in the database,  and close the connection.

Create a UserService and annotate with @Service annotation.
The UserServices takes a UserRepository in the constructor and has 
User create(UserCreateParams params) method.

The create method should create a new User object and save it using the repository save method.

The UserCreateParams has the following fields:

String username and String name. Both should not be null.

Create an slf4j logger in UserService class and print the log at the beginning of the create() and the end of the create() method. 

// LOGGER.debug Creating a user for the provided creation params - $params 
// LOGGER.debug  Successfully created a user for the provided creation params - $params, result - $user

Create tests for all components
