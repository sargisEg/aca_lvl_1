Create a UserCrudRepository that takes a Connection in the constructor.

Create User save(User user) method that creates an insertion statement and executes it.

The User class is annotated with @Table(name = "users") and has the following fields:

@Column(name = "full_name")
private String name;

@Column(name = "age")
private Integer age;

Run the Postgres container, and expose 5432 port to localhost.

docker run -d -p 7432:5432 postgres:9.6.12

Create UserCrudRepositoryIntegrationTest and testSave() integration test, that creates a new User and saves it in a database.

Make sure that the test result is passed (user has been added to the database users table).
