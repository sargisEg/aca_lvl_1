There is a pool to understand how many types of car models society drive.

Create a program that asks different users to type his/her name, the car brand, and the model that he/she drives.

The program should print the number of unique car brand/name pairs and each of them in a sorted manner.

e.g

please type your name, the brand, and model of your car

John bmw 7
Jack opel astra
Mary bmw 7
finish

Number of unique brand and models: 2
bmw 7
opel astra


note: note an askAndCalcualte method that asks a user for an input and returns a set of cars.
 Create a separate method to print the result. Write a unit test on askAndCalcualte method.
